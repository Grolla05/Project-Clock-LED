## 🧩 What is DigitalClock?

**DigitalClock** is a project developed with the goal of creating a **complete digital clock** capable of accurately counting hours, minutes, and seconds using **only discrete electronic components and digital logic circuits**, **without any programming languages or microcontrollers**.

The project was designed to practically apply knowledge acquired in **Electronics** and **Digital Circuits** courses, resulting in a system capable of operating continuously and stably, displaying the time in real-time on **seven-segment LED displays**.
