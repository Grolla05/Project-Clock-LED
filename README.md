**1. INTRODUCTION**

This report details the development of a digital clock with seven-segment LED displays, a project that integrates fundamental concepts of digital and analog electronics. The architecture of the implemented circuit employs a variety of discrete components to perform the continuous counting and display of time in hours, minutes and seconds. The central sequential logic is built using D-type flip-flops, responsible for storing and advancing the counting states. The system timing is generated by an oscillator based on the NE555 integrated circuit, whose frequency is subsequently divided by asynchronous counters implemented with D flip-flops to obtain the necessary time bases. The conversion of the binary codes of the counters to the display format on the seven-segment displays is performed by BCD-to-seven-segment decoders. Additionally, the project incorporates logic gates (AND, OR, NOT) to implement the counter control logic and the clock adjustment and reset circuits, demonstrating a complete solution based on dedicated hardware.

**2. OBJECTIVE**

The main objective of this project was to develop a functional digital clock capable of accurately counting hours, minutes and seconds, using only discrete electronic circuits and digital logic components, without the use of programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãor microcontrollers. The aim was to apply in a practical way the knowledge acquired in Electronics and Digital Circuits courses, focusing on the construction of a complete timing and display system on seven-segment LED displays. The specific objectives of the project include:

* Design and implement a rectifier power supply with adequate filtering to power the digital circuits;
* Develop a clock generation system using delay and frequency division circuits to provide stable pulses;
* Develop synchronous and asynchronous counters using D flip-flops to count units and tens of seconds, minutes and hours;
* Integrate binary decoders for 7 segments with the counters, allowing the correct display of time values.

At the end of the project, the system was expected to be able to operate continuously, stably and accurately, correctly representing time in digital format with real-time updates on LED displays.

**3. METHODOLOGY**

The methodology adopted for the development of the LED digital clock was based on a sequential approach, structured in interdependent stages, from the theoretical analysis of the circuits involved to the practical assembly and functional tests in the laboratory. The project was conducted entirely based on hardware, using discrete electronic components and classic digital circuits, which required detailed planning and careful validation of each subsystem. Initially, a theoretical study of the main functional blocks required was carried out: power supply, clock generator, counters, decoders and display circuits. This stage included the review of concepts such as alternating current rectification and filtering, D flip-flop operation, binary counting logic, decoding for seven-segment displays and multiplexing techniques. Based on this study, the circuits were schematized in modular stages:

* **Rectifier Power Supply::** conversion of alternating current into direct current using diodes and capacitors, with dimensions appropriate to the voltage and current required by the logic circuits.
* **Clock Generator and Delay Circuit:** creation of a stable time base using oscillators and a sequential frequency divider of 12 flip-flops for frequency control.
* **Counters and Registers:** implementation of synchronous binary counters with D flip-flops for counting seconds, minutes and hours, with automatic resets configured for 60 seconds/minutes and 24 hours.
* **Decoders and Display:** use of BCD decoder circuits for 7 segments connected to the counters, allowing display on common cathode displays.

Each step was individually tested to validate its operation before the system was fully integrated. The assembly process initially used a protoboard, followed by final assembly on a standard board with solder, ensuring robustness and stability in the continuous operation of the clock. The practical methodology reinforced the understanding of the theoretical concepts involved, in addition to developing diagnostic and fault correction skills during assembly, contributing to the student's complete technical training.

**4. THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT**

**4.1 Transformer and Rectifier Source**

The main objective of the rectifier source developed for the digital clock project was to provide a stable continuous voltage of approximately 5V, suitable for the operation of digital circuits. The circuit was designed in stages, starting with the conversion of the alternating voltage from the electrical network. A transformer with a 127V input and 12V AC output was used, responsible for reducing the voltage from the electrical network to a safe level compatible with the subsequent electronic circuits. Next, four rectifier diodes were arranged in a Graetz bridge configuration, allowing full-wave rectification ‚Äî that is, the conversion of both half-cycles of the alternating current into unidirectional pulses, increasing the energy efficiency of the system.

The output of the rectifier bridge was connected to a 220ŒºF electrolytic capacitor with a working voltage between 35V and 50V, which had the function of filtering the rectified voltage, significantly reducing ripples and storing charge to provide a more continuous voltage to the other components. To further stabilize the output voltage and protect sensitive circuits, a regulator circuit with a transistor and Zener diode was incorporated. The BD135 transistor, of the NPN type, was used as a current amplification and switching element, acting as a linear regulator. Its base was polarized by means of a voltage divider formed by a 1kŒ© resistor and the 1N4734A Zener diode, with a breakdown voltage of approximately 5.6V. This Zener maintained a constant voltage at the base of the transistor, allowing the emitter output voltage to be regulated around 5V, suitable for the TTL and CMOS logic circuits used in the project.

The 1kŒ© resistor was used to limit the current flowing through the Zener diode, protecting it against overcurrent and ensuring its operation in the controlled avalanche region. In this way, the RC, transistor and Zener assembly formed a simple but efficient regulator, capable of providing a stabilized direct voltage with sufficient current to power the flip-flops, decoders, displays and other digital elements of the clock. The correct selection and dimensioning of these components were essential to ensure the reliability of the system and avoid failures resulting from variations in the power supply.

**4.2 Analog-to-Digital Converter, NE555 Oscillator**

In the design of the digital clock with LED, an oscillator was implemented using the NE555 integrated circuit, configured in stable mode. Its main function is to generate a clock signal, a periodic square wave essential for the synchronization and sequential operation of the various digital components of the system, including the time counting logic and the control of the LEDs. The NE555, operating as an oscillator, will produce continuous electrical pulses with a frequency determined by the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the resistors (one of 1kŒ© and another of 10kŒ© in series) and the 250 mF capacitor connected externally. This configuration allows the generation of a clock signal with a period of approximately one hour, dictating the rhythm at which the time information will be updated and displayed by the LEDs. The 10 nF capacitor connected to the control pin (pin 5) has the function of decoupling noise and ensuring the stability of the oscillator operation. The output of this oscillator (pin 3 of NE555) will provide the clock signal needed for the digital clock logic.

**4.3 Wave Regulation Circuit**

The implemented frequency divider circuit inherently introduces a concept of signal delay, since the 1 Hz output waveform is generated only after a specific number of cycles of the 3600 Hz input waveform have accumulated. This delay, although essential for frequency division, illustrates the importance of timing and synchronization in digital systems. In the context of a digital clock, for example, the accuracy in generating lower frequency pulses (such as the second, minute, and hour pulses) is crucial for maintaining accurate timekeeping and synchronization with other system components. The delay introduced by the frequency divider needs to be carefully considered in the design of more complex systems to ensure the coordinated operation of all its elements.

**4.4 Counters and Registers**

Time counting in the digital clock was performed by means of a sequential system composed of interconnected JK flip-flops, forming synchronous and asynchronous counters responsible for counting seconds, minutes and hours. The main clock that feeds the first flip-flop of the system was configured to operate with a period of 500ms, corresponding to a frequency of 2Hz, ensuring that two complete pulses represent exactly one second ‚Äî thus allowing accurate time counting based on digital pulses. Each counting unit was built with flip-flops connected so that the ùëÑ Q output of one stage feeds the clock input of the next, resulting in an increasing binary count with each pulse. These groups of flip-flops function as 4-bit registers, representing the digits in binary, which are later decoded to display. To control the transition between segments (units to tens of seconds, minutes and hours), an AND logic gate was inserted at the end of each register. This gate is configured to detect when the binary content of the register reaches its maximum programmed value (such as 1001 to count up to 9, or 0101 to count up to 5, as the case may be). When this condition is met, the AND gate output generates a high logic pulse (level 1), used for two main functions: first, this pulse is connected to the clock input of the first flip-flop of the next register, promoting the increment of the next decimal place of the clock (for example, from units to tens of seconds); second, the same signal acts on the reset circuit of the flip-flops of the corresponding register, forcing them to return to the logic 0 state and restart the count. This system of counters and control logic ensures that the count is continuous, synchronized and compatible with the decimal structure shown on the 7-segment displays. The use of AND gates as maximum state detectors and advance pulse generators made it possible to eliminate the need for programmable elements, keeping all the logic based on discrete components and combinational logic.

**5. PRACTICAL DEVELOPMENT**

**5.1 Rectifier Power Supply**

Assembling the rectifier power supply was essential to ensure adequate power supply for the LED clock's integrated logic circuit. The circuit was built using four bridge rectifier diodes, responsible for converting alternating voltage into pulsating direct voltage. A 220¬µF electrolytic capacitor was then inserted to filter the voltage, smoothing out oscillations and providing a more stable output. To limit the current and protect subsequent components, we used a 1kŒ© resistor in series with the load. A 5.6V zener diode was used to regulate the output voltage, ensuring constant power supply to the digital circuit. In addition, a 137 transistor was inserted as part of the power supply stabilization stage, acting as an additional regulator. The circuit's power supply was a transformer connected directly to the 127V electrical network, with an output of 6V in alternating current. After rectification, a continuous voltage of approximately 8.5V was measured at the output of the diode bridge. With the filtering of the capacitor, this voltage stabilized at around 8.2 V. Finally, after regulation by the zener diode and the transistor, a final output voltage close to 5.6 V was obtained, suitable for the operation of the clock's digital circuits.

**5.2 Analog-to-Digital Converter, NE555 Oscillator**

When we set out on the bench, the first step was to physically implement the stable oscillator using the NE555 integrated circuit. The resistors and capacitor, carefully selected to obtain the desired clock frequency, were soldered onto a protoboard. The circuit's power supply was connected, and the indicator LED connected to the NE555 output began to flash, providing a first visual indication of the oscillation.
For a more accurate analysis, we connected the oscilloscope probes to the output of pin 3 of the NE555. The oscilloscope display clearly displayed a square wave, confirming the generation of the clock signal. We adjusted the time base and vertical scale to visualize the voltage levels (close to 0V and the supply voltage) and the periodicity of the pulses. We observed the clear transition between the high and low states, essential for the correct triggering of the flip-flops in the next stage of the project. This practical verification assured us that the clock source was working as expected, providing a clean signal suitable for the counting progression in the digital circuit.

**5.3 Wave Regulation Circuit**

The practical implementation of the delay circuit involved assembling a sequential chain of 12 flip-flops, interconnected to introduce a specific delay in the signal that passes through them. Each flip-flop, when ‚Äúclocked‚Äù, propagates the state from the input to the output with a small intrinsic delay. The cascade of 12 of these elements cumulatively generates the desired delay. On the bench, assembly required attention to the correct connection of the data inputs, clock and outputs of each flip-flop in the sequence. After powering the circuit, we injected a test pulse into the input of the first flip-flop in the chain and observed the propagation of this pulse through the others using the oscilloscope. We positioned the test leads at strategic points along the chain to visualize the progressive delay introduced by each flip-flop.
The evaluation of the delay time stability was performed by applying repetitive pulses and checking whether the interval between the input signal and the output signal of the last flip-flop remained constant. We observed that the total delay was the sum of the individual propagation delays of each flip-flop. Small variations in the total delay time could be noticed, possibly influenced by subtle differences in the characteristics of each component and by the clock frequency used. However, under the test conditions, the circuit demonstrated considerable stability in the introduced delay, confirming the feasibility of using a chain of flip-flops to implement a controllable time delay in our system.

**5.4 Counters and Registers**

In practice, implementing the counting logic for hours, minutes and seconds involved assembling several digital counters, probably binary or BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) counters, depending on the desired representation for the display. Each time unit (seconds, minutes and hours) required a specific set of counters, interconnected to perform the correct increment and ‚Äúrollover‚Äù to the higher unit (for example, from 59 seconds to 0 minutes).
The bench came to life with the arrangement of the counters‚Äô integrated circuits, the connecting wires and the pull-up or pull-down resistors necessary to ensure the appropriate logic levels. The power supply for each counter was carefully connected, and the clock signals, coming from the oscillator circuit implemented previously, were distributed to the clock inputs of each counting stage.
The next crucial step was to integrate the counters with the seven-segment LED displays that display the time. For this purpose, BCD-to-seven-segment decoders were probably used, which convert the binary or BCD output of the counters into signals suitable for lighting the correct segments of the displays, forming the numerical digits. The connection between the decoder outputs and the pins of the LED displays was made by means of current-limiting resistors, protecting the LEDs from damage. When energizing the complete circuit, we observed the counting sequence on the LED displays. We checked that the seconds count progressed correctly from 0 to 59, that the minutes were incremented every 60 seconds, and that the hours followed the same logic after 59 minutes. Fine adjustments to the connections and power supply were made until the time count was accurate and the display on the LED displays was clear and without errors. This practical step consolidated the functionality of the counting logic and its correct visual presentation.

**6. COMPLEMENTARY CIRCUITS**

**6.1 Clock Time Adjustment**

To provide an intuitive method of adjusting the time on a digital clock, the design incorporates a control circuit that changes the timing dynamics when the buttons are pressed. Instead of a single increment per press, holding down one of the adjustment buttons (S1 or S2) temporarily accelerates the clock frequency that powers the counters. This acceleration allows the minutes and hours digits to be rapidly advanced to the desired value. Additionally, simultaneously pressing both adjustment buttons (S1 and S2) implements a full clock reset function. This action forces all registers to a predefined initial state, restarting the time count from zero. This simplified approach to manual adjustment eliminates the need for repetitive presses for large changes and provides a quick way to reset the system when necessary, while maintaining the integrity of the counters' sequential logic during normal operation.

**6.2 Unit Separation LEDs**

To improve visualization and visually separate the hour, minute and second segments on the display, a circuit with separation LEDs between each of the time units was implemented. This circuit uses a total of four LEDs, arranged to alternate the hours, minutes and seconds digits on the 7-segment display. Each pair of LEDs, two on each separator, was connected to an inverter gate (NOT), with the gate input connected directly to the system's original clock ‚Äî the same clock that powers the flip-flops responsible for counting.

The function of this configuration is to keep the LEDs constantly lit while the clock is running, since the inverter inverts the phase of the original clock signal. Thus, when the clock signal is at a high level, the inverter gate generates a low level at the output, and vice versa, causing the LEDs to always remain lit, regardless of the value contained in the hour, minute or second registers. This creates a continuous visual effect, clearly highlighting the separation between time units, without interfering with the counting operation or the display of values. The use of the inverter gate, together with the original clock, ensures simple and efficient control to keep the LEDs illuminated throughout the clock's operating cycle.

**6.3 Battery Level Indicator**

The battery power meter circuit was implemented to provide a visual and intuitive indication of the remaining charge level of the battery that powers the system. This indicator consists of four LEDs connected in parallel, each in series with a 1kŒ© resistor, forming a simple and efficient arrangement for monitoring the percentage of the source voltage. The circuit is powered directly from the battery terminals, without the need for complex measurement circuits or microcontrollers.

Each LED represents a fraction of 25% of the total battery charge: with all four LEDs lit, the system is operating at full charge (100%); with three LEDs, the estimated charge is 75%; two LEDs indicate 50%, and only one LED lit represents approximately 25% of the remaining capacity. When all LEDs are off, it is assumed that the battery is close to being completely discharged.

Dividing the current between the 1kŒ© resistors ensures adequate limitation of the current passing through each LED, preventing overload and extending the life of the components. The parallel connection allows the activation of the LEDs to be directly influenced by the battery voltage: as the voltage level decreases, the potential difference is no longer sufficient to activate all the LEDs, causing them to gradually turn off, according to their position in the circuit. This simple and effective method provides the user with an instant visual reading of the power supply status, contributing to preventive maintenance and ensuring the reliable operation of the digital clock.

**7. CONCLUSIONS**

The development of the LED digital clock proposed in this project allowed the practical application of several fundamental concepts of digital and analog electronics, through the construction of a fully integrated circuit, without the use of programming. The system structure was organized into interdependent modules, starting with the rectifier source, composed of a 127V to 12V transformer, four rectifier diodes, a 220¬µF capacitor, a 1kŒ© resistor, a BD135 transistor and a 1N4734A Zener diode, which together provided a stabilized power supply for the circuit.

The core of the system was built based on D flip-flops, organized into binary registers and counters that, through connections between ùëÑ Q outputs and subsequent clock inputs, ensured the accurate counting of seconds, minutes and hours. The control logic was complemented with AND gates, responsible for detecting the maximum value of each register and triggering both the reset of the flip-flops and the advancement of the next register. The clock signal, operating at 1Hz (1s), was the basis for the synchronization of the entire count.

To ensure interactivity, a time adjustment system was implemented, in which buttons inserted between the AND gates and the flip-flops allowed manual advancement of each register. The time display was organized with 7-segment displays, separated by auxiliary LEDs controlled by inverter gates connected to the clock, keeping them always lit to clearly delimit the time units.

In addition, a battery power indicator was incorporated with four LEDs and 1kŒ© resistors connected in parallel, allowing a visual reading of the remaining charge based on the available voltage of the source. This compact and practical solution provides a clear notion of the energy status of the system.

Thus, the final project unified knowledge in rectification, voltage stabilization, sequential logic with flip-flops, decoding, state control and signaling by LEDs, demonstrating the feasibility of building a functional digital clock without resorting to programmable components, only with logic circuits and discrete devices.
